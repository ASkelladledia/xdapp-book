# Example Project: xMint

## Summary

xMint is a sample project that uses Ultra Light Clients and Contract Controlled Transfers to allow users to to pay in their native currency to receive tokens from a foreign chain. It does this by bridging the native currency over to the foreign chain, then purchasing the foreign tokens, and bridging the foreign tokens back to their native chain wallet. 

Behind this simple transaction is a set of complex Wormhole interactions.
