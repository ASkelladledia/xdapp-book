#Tooling

regardless of what env you use, there are some wormhole-specific tools you should know about. Most developers find it useful to clone the Wormhole core repository, as it has quite a few useful tools.

worm CLI tool (link to code) - great cli tool for getting odds and ends done surround wormhole contracts, VAAs and more
orchestrator - WIP tool which is connected to the WLV environment. Can be useful for managing deployment of your xDapp contracts
reference bridge UI - a GUI which can be used to perform token transfers around the ecosystem
Wormhole Typescript SDK - typescript SDK designed to aid in interacting directly with the Wormhole contracts.
Explorer - mainnet link, and link to local code. Can be a good resource for looking at individual transfers
Wormhole Rust SDKs - useful when working in the various Rust environments, WIP, link to source
Spydk - useful for listening to the guardian network (link to source code and official release)
