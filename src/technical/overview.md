# Contract Development

This section should help you get off the ground with contract development in the Wormhole ecosystem.

It is written in a fashion which assumes familiarity with smart contract development in each ecosystem. As such, it doesn't provide information on smart contract basics, and instead focuses on how to properly interact with the provided Wormhole functions.

While the syntax for each programming environment differs, the general structure of the code and best practices tend to be quite similar. You should consider referencing the sections for environments other than the one you're working in, as many of the concepts outlined here are universal to cross-chain development.
