## Example: xDex

    - Why: The goal of xDex is to make the world's best dex. We want to support users from every chain, we want to support every asset those users could want, and we want this dex to be managed by on-chain governance.

    - Target Ecosystems: We want to support wallet users from every blockchain which has full Wormhole support, but we are less concerned about smart contract developers being able to compose on top of us.

    - Data flows: There are three key data flows. Swaps, liquidity providing, and governance.

    - Liquidity & Tokens: We want to minimize liquidity fragmentation in order to support large swaps. We also want users from any chain to be able to vote in governance or provision liquidity.

## Example: xDex

    - We needs to support users from all these ecosystems.
    - We want to minimize our number of contracts so as to reduce implementation complexity and smart contract risk.
