cross chain applications, but more crucially, applications which are built for a cross-chain world. Leverage the strengths of each blockchain.
Utilize xData to design powerful decentralized protocols which view individual blockchains as implementation details. xAssets are divorcible from the app and can move tokens across the ecosystem and custody on any chain.

# What is an xDapp

The term **xDapp** is short for "Cross-Chain Decentralized Application". At first glance, this might give the impression that xDapps are simply Dapps which meddle a bit in doing cross-chain things. However, once you get into the business of building decentralized products which are designed to operate across a variety of blockchains and runtimes, you begin to see that these applications are architected in a fundamentally different fashion than traditional Dapps.

The Wormhole Core Layer implements xData, which acts as a shared repository of data across the entire Wormhole Ecosystem. xDapps have the capacity to perform all the operations of traditional Dapps, but they also utilize this xData. This xData allows xDapp developers to build from a top-down, message-passing approach, rather than the bottom-up world of Dapp developers.

Something we'll dive deeper into during the xDapp Architecture chapter is the philosophy of **Protocol-First Design**. Protocol First Design is an approach to building decentralized applications whereby the first order of business is to lay out your application into a series of data structures, APIs, and message payloads. Once you've laid out your application into a high-level protocol, the protocol acts as an agreement to which all of your components must adhere. From there, the smart contracts underlying this protocol can be considered an implementation detail.

If you're familiar at all with web2 development, you'll immediately notice that this philosophy is quite analogous to microservice architecture. This is no coincidence, as similar problems should expect to be solved by similar solutions, and the Wormhole Core Layer is quite analogous to the OSI Network Model in many ways.

Thus, a more fitting depiction of xDapps might be to see them as **Distributed Decentralized Applications**, which have multiple, specialized components working in unison to implement a protocol which delivers a smooth, unified user experience across a variety of layer 1 ecosystems.

So far we've taken a really high-level and abstract approach to explaining what xDapps are. In the next section we'll get back to real world, and summarize the concrete advantages which xDapps built on Wormhole have over traditional apps today.
