# Wormhole

In the previous chapter, we established concepts like xDapps, xData, and xAssets. In this chapter, we'll dive into the inner workings of the Wormhole ecosystem, and how they give rise to these ideas.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a clear understanding of what Wormhole is, what its key components are, and how each of those components comes together to create a powerful, new cross-chain ecosystem.
